# Photobooth
Windows 10 IOT Canon PhotoBooth

This is a personnal projet to build a custom photobooth for a friend's wedding.
My first intention is to use :
- a raspberry pi 2
- Windows 10 IoT (to code in C#)
- a Canon Rebel T2i Camera (550d in Europe)
- a Xbox one gamepad to pilot the software (i don't have a touchscreen, yet)
- an old 17' vga monitor
and many motivation!

Maybe this can help someone one day...
