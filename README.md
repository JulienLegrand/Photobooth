# Photobooth
Windows 10 IOT Canon PhotoBooth

This is a personnal projet to build a custom photobooth for a friend's wedding.
My first intention is to use :
- a raspberry pi 2
- Windows 10 IoT (to code in C#)
- a Canon Rebel T2i Camera (550d in Europe)
- a Xbox one gamepad to pilot the software (i don't have a touchscreen, yet)
- an old 17' vga monitor
and many motivation!

Notes :
Project stopped at this time.
But the motivation is not dead :
It was easier to go with python on raspberry, but C# and mono could do the job too.
I keep these files because it contains code to catch xbox one buttons press events on W10 IOT.
